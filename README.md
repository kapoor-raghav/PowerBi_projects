This repository adds Power BI dashboards developed during my learning journey: Insurance Analysis and Store Analysis. Both projects highlight DAX calculations, dynamic filters, and interactive visuals for clear business insights.
# 📊 Power BI Project Dashboards

This repository showcases two interactive Power BI dashboards built during my data visualization learning journey. The purpose of these projects was to strengthen my skills in Power BI by working with different datasets and applying advanced features such as DAX calculations, custom measures, and dynamic filtering. Each dashboard highlights a distinct domain—insurance analysis and store analysis—demonstrating how Power BI can be used to uncover insights and support decision‑making.

## 🎯 Purpose
The primary goal was to gain hands‑on experience with Power BI’s modeling and visualization capabilities. By designing dashboards independently, I focused on learning how to connect raw data, build relationships, and create measures that drive meaningful analysis. These projects also emphasize storytelling with data, ensuring that dashboards are not only technically sound but also intuitive and user‑friendly.

## 📁 Dashboards
### Insurance Analysis Dashboard
Provides a comprehensive view of claims, premiums, and customer segments. It highlights risk patterns, profitability, and financial performance, enabling stakeholders to identify trends and areas of concern.

### Store Analysis Dashboard
Focuses on retail performance across product categories, sales channels, and customer behavior. It includes KPIs for revenue, inventory, and profitability, helping managers track performance and make operational decisions.
